A few scripts for creating bookmarks for giving out at conferences. In each case the goal of the bookmarks are to drive 'clicks' to websites. Inspired by conversations in Northwestern Universities PBC 450 seminar on Visual Presentations.

The visual inspiration for this is work by Danielle Navarro which she shared at posticonf 2022, and is available to [view here](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-2/session-2/), and in a github repo [here](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/art-from-code/tree/main). In particular her work on mosaica is the most visual I've ever seen some produce via code.
